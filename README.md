# MCA

MIPS Code Analyzer it's a little program, capable of analyze some data of a MIPS archive or an alternative archive containing some MIPS code.

# Runing this little piece of... heaven...

First: Make sure you have python installed on your machine. (why wouldn't you have? :( )

Second: Just put the main.py file in the same folder of your .asm codes and run with, (python 3.x) **py main.py**, command on your terminal or, (python 2.x) **python main2.py**.

# Features

The code must be capable of Measure and Execute:

1. Total application instructions. 
2. Total memory read instructions and its percentage in relation with total instructions.
3. Total memory write instructions and its percentage in relation with total instructions.
4. Total conditional jump instructions and its percentage in relation with total instructions.
5. Total unconditional jump instructions and its percentage in relation with total instructions.
6. Total Arithmetic and Logic Instructions.
7. List all registers used by the application.

# Features Covered So Far...
- [x] Total application instructions.
- [x] Total memory read instructions and its percentage in relation with total instructions.
- [x] Total memory write instructions and its percentage in relation with total instructions.
- [x] Total conditional jump instructions and its percentage in relation with total instructions.
- [x] Total unconditional jump instructions and its percentage in relation with total instructions.
- [x] Total Arithmetic and Logic Instructions.
- [x] List all registers used by the application.

# Some Observations...

The code generates some archives, like the output_commands.txt, where we list all the instructions used.
